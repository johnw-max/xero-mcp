# Accounting connector capability contract

## Purpose

Accounting Skills contain provider-neutral business judgment. The Agent/runtime discovers authorized capabilities and routes a canonical accounting intent. MCP servers and adapters execute data access or actions and return normalized receipts.

MCP is a protocol boundary, not a promise that every server has the same accounting meaning. Portability requires the same semantic capability contract or an explicit adapter mapping.

```text
Accounting Skill
  -> provider-neutral AccountingIntent
  -> capability router / domain runtime
      -> SourceStore adapter -> file or document system
      -> WorkStore adapter   -> review/workflow store
      -> Ledger adapter      -> formal accounting system
```

## Layer ownership

### Skill

- interpret the economic event and evidence;
- propose the business route and balanced debit/credit treatment;
- define missing information, approval, and exception rules;
- state the highest truthful business outcome.

The Skill must not depend on `xero_*`, Google Drive tool names, OAuth fields, provider tenant IDs, folder IDs, workbook ranges, or raw API payloads.

### Capability router and domain runtime

- normalize `AccountingIntent` and lifecycle state;
- calculate effective capabilities for the current actor, connection, entity, and action;
- select an authorized adapter without changing the accounting meaning;
- enforce policy, approval, idempotency, audit, and outcome recovery;
- normalize receipts and preserve provider-specific state semantics.

### MCP and provider adapter

- map the canonical intent to provider operations;
- enforce tenant/entity binding, scopes, permission, write gate, and destination role;
- validate provider references and legal state transitions;
- perform the action and exact read-back;
- return structured success, partial, failed, or outcome-unknown receipts.

Deterministic controls such as balance, tenant binding, approval match, idempotency, valid period/account/tax, and duplicate prevention must not depend only on model compliance with a Skill.

## Fact provenance and ledger-target gate

Classify each business fact by origin and destination role:

- `USER_ASSERTED`: supplied in user text, remembered conversation, an example, a filename, or an attachment statement. It may be a requested entity label or source assertion, but never establishes the authorized ledger target.
- `HOST_BOUND`: supplied by the authenticated host/runtime for the active connection and binding revision.
- `MCP_READ`: returned by an authorized capability with a receipt bound to the active connection, destination role, target, and binding revision.

`MCP_READ` is not automatically a ledger fact: a source- or work-store read can support source/review facts but cannot establish the formal-ledger organisation. Before any current-ledger fact, join, or action, the runtime must obtain `TARGET_VERIFIED` from `ledger.target.resolve` or an equally authoritative `HOST_BOUND` manifest. Re-resolve for a new conversation and after any binding-revision change. A later ledger receipt is usable only when its safe target reference and binding revision match that verified target.

Every read result used as evidence must carry a normalized envelope. The minimum fields are role-specific rather than pretending every connector is a ledger:

```text
common: fact_origin, source_system, destination_role, capability_id,
        tool_call_or_audit_ref, observed_at, output_hash, fact_paths[]
bounded list/report reads: query_bounds, completeness
connector_control_plane: connection_ref_safe, connection_state
source_store: source_object_ref_safe
work_store: work_scope_or_record_ref_safe
ledger_sor: bound_target_ref_safe, organisation_display_name,
            binding_revision, capability_revision
```

`fact_paths[]` binds each asserted field to a response field or JSON pointer. For `ledger.target.resolve`, the envelope must bind the organisation display name and base currency when returned. A source/work-store receipt can support only the returned material, work scope, or review object; it cannot establish a ledger target or ledger state. Raw provider secrets and sensitive target locators remain server-side.

Keep the provenance gate separate from accounting lifecycle state:

- `TARGET_UNVERIFIED`: target resolution is absent, failed, empty, stale, or missing its evidence envelope. Do not state current ledger facts or perform ledger-scoped joins/actions.
- `TARGET_VERIFIED`: current host/MCP evidence resolves one target and later ledger reads match its binding revision.
- `TARGET_CONFLICT`: current receipts or host context identify different targets/revisions. Keep results separate and block ledger-scoped joins/actions.
- `READ_EVIDENCE_REJECTED`: a read value lacks the required target/provenance envelope or field binding. Do not promote it to a current-ledger fact.

The model may still analyze clearly labeled user/source assertions outside the ledger, but it must not silently upgrade them to `HOST_BOUND` or `MCP_READ`. The platform/runtime should enforce these gates deterministically; prompt compliance alone is not sufficient.

## Destination roles

- `connector_control_plane`: connection health and binding-resolution observations only; it is not an accounting destination and never proves a ledger target or ledger state.
- `source_store`: original documents and source metadata.
- `work_store`: cases/work scopes, extracted fields, review records, proposals, approvals, handoffs, and workflow audit.
- `ledger_sor`: authoritative accounting transactions, journals, subledgers, reports, reconciliations, and period state.

One connection may implement several roles. One workflow may compose several connections. A destination may be used only for its authorized role.

## AccountingIntent

```text
intent_id
business_action
entity_ref / period / transaction_date
transaction_currency / reporting_currency
source_refs[]
economic_event
preferred_route: native_transaction | manual_journal
balanced_lines[]
unresolved_items[]
proposal_version / proposal_digest
```

Examples of `business_action` include `record_supplier_bill`, `record_sales_invoice`, `record_payment`, `record_receipt`, `record_transfer`, `record_adjustment`, `reconcile_balance`, and `assess_close`.

Without live ledger reference data, use account-family and tax-treatment candidates. Do not invent provider account codes, tax IDs, contact IDs, or open-period status.

## Stable semantic capabilities

### Connector/runtime

```text
connector.connection.status.read
```

### Source and work

```text
source.metadata.read
source.content.read
source.original.preserve
source.original.readback
work.scope.resolve
work.material.persist
work.material.readback
work.review_record.persist
work.review_record.readback
work.review_record.search
work.proposal.persist
work.proposal.readback
work.open_item.persist
work.open_item.read
work.reconciliation_candidate.persist
work.reconciliation_candidate.read
work.approval.read
```

### Formal ledger

```text
ledger.target.resolve
ledger.reference.accounts.read
ledger.reference.tax.read
ledger.reference.counterparty.read
ledger.reference.item.read
ledger.period.status.read
ledger.transaction.search
ledger.transaction.native.prepare
ledger.transaction.native.execute
ledger.transaction.journal.prepare
ledger.transaction.journal.execute
ledger.object.read_exact
ledger.report.read
ledger.report.trial_balance.read
ledger.reconciliation.verify
ledger.period.lock
```

### Controls

```text
control.approval.verify
control.outcome.reconcile
```

Tool names may differ by provider. A deployment profile maps each mounted tool to one or more capability IDs. The Skill checks effective capability, not server identity.

## Effective capability manifest

Calculate this for the current actor, entity, connection, and action:

```text
connection_ref_safe
destination_role: source_store | work_store | ledger_sor
bound_target_ref_safe
fact_origin: HOST_BOUND | MCP_READ
binding_revision
capability_id
available
supported_object_types[]
control_requirement
deny_reasons[]
adapter_version
capability_revision
last_verified_at
```

Effective capability is the intersection of release policy, connection health, bound target, OAuth scope, user permission, write gate, object/action support, and required approval. The appearance of one tool must not imply any other capability on that server.

## Execution and normalized receipt

```text
describeCapabilities(context)
resolveTarget(context)
readReferenceData(intent)
prepare(intent, mappedReferences)
execute(preparedRef, verifiedApproval)
readBack(providerObjectRef)
queryOutcome(attemptRef)
readReport(reportSpec)
```

Normalize every external result:

```text
result_class: succeeded | partial | failed | outcome_unknown
intent_id / attempt_id
idempotency_result
adapter_type / capability_revision
fact_origin / source_system / destination_role / capability_id
bound_target_ref_safe
organisation_display_name / binding_revision / observed_at
tool_call_or_audit_ref / query_bounds / completeness / output_hash
fact_paths[]
provider_object_ref_safe
provider_state
ledger_effective: true | false | unknown
receipt_ref_or_hash
readback_attempted / readback_result_class
readback_verified / readback_digest / readback_at
verified_fields[]
next_gate
```

Keep `source_state`, `proposal_state`, `ledger_state`, `reconciliation_state`, and `close_state` separate. Only `ledger_effective=true` plus exact read-back permits `POSTED_READBACK_VERIFIED`.

Capability availability and action outcome are separate facts. A mounted exact-read capability may still time out or fail for one attempt; retain `WRITE_RESULT_UNVERIFIED` until a later read-back succeeds. A write may also return `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` when no outcome-query capability is available; retain the unknown state, prohibit blind resubmission, and route to manual investigation.

## Graceful degradation

| Effective capabilities | Maximum truthful outcome |
|---|---|
| Missing, stale, failed, or conflicting ledger-target evidence | `TARGET_UNVERIFIED` or `TARGET_CONFLICT`; no current-ledger fact, join, or action |
| Ledger read without the required target/provenance envelope | `READ_EVIDENCE_REJECTED`; value is not authoritative current-ledger evidence |
| No relevant connector | balanced proposal in chat; unsaved |
| A source/work-store persistence action | source or proposal saved outside the ledger, even if a ledger connector is also mounted but unused |
| Ledger reference reads | mapped and validated proposal; unposted |
| Ledger non-effective draft write + exact read-back | provider draft; unposted |
| Definitive successful ledger write without successful exact read-back | `WRITE_RESULT_UNVERIFIED`; no posted claim |
| Timeout or ambiguous execution result | `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; query the original attempt when supported, otherwise investigate manually, and never resubmit blindly |
| Exact read-back conflicts with the approved intent | `WRITE_RESULT_MISMATCH`; investigate without blind retry |
| Ledger-effective write + exact read-back | posted and read-back verified |
| Trial Balance read | separate Trial Balance evidence only |
| Reconciliation verify | separate account-level reconciliation evidence only |
| Close controls + approval + period lock + independent locked-status read-back | `CLOSED_VERIFIED` for the exact entity and period |

Do not silently fall back to another company, connector, workbook, folder, database, or provider. A file/storage receipt never proves posting, Trial Balance, formal reconciliation, or close.
